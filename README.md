# anly_560_lab2

This repository contains files regarding Lab 2 for the ANLY 560 course at Harrisburg University. The goal for Lab 2 for ANLY 560 course was to write a Java code which calculated the average of 5 grades, and then presented a specific output/response based on the average grade.

I've upoaded a .txt file which contains the code used for the lab, and a screenshot which details the output of the lab.
